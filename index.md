# My Projects
### Predicting House Prices
**Summary:** The goal of this project was to predict house prices using the [Ames, Iowa Housing Market Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). An Exploratory Data Analysis revealed outliers to exclude, missingness to address, variables to transform, and features to engineer. EDA also revealed many ordinal variables, which were treated categorically, continuously, and as a mix. Each treatment of ordinal data was modeled using parameter tuned algorithms including regularized linear regression, random forests, and gradient boosted decision trees. Results were primarily evaluated on root-mean-square error (RMSE), with secondary consideration given to model runtime.
**Topics:** data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, machine learning, regression
**Toolkit:** Python, Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, SKLearn, XGBoost
