I am a data scientist currently open to opportunities based in the Chicago area or remote. In 2009 I received a bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of Arizona, with a minor in Business Administration. After several years working in operations & project management, I found myself intrigued by insights extracted through data science and the power that machine learning provides in making data informed decisions.<br>
<br>
In 2018, I enrolled in and graduated from <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/bootcamp/data-science/flexible/#specializations">Thinkful's Data Science Program</a>, a comprehensive bootcamp and mentorship centered around statistical analysis and machine learning algorithm theory and implementation. Throughout this learning experience, I was drawn to problems involving economic and sequence data, and chose to specialize in time series and deep learning.<br>
<br>
When I'm not immersed in data, you'll probably find me enjoying live music, investigating a new pizza or taco spot, or watching baseball and Formula 1 racing.
